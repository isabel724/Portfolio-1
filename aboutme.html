    <p> Working through the code to create the roulette game today was really frustrating because with each part of the code more and more probelms 
  arose within the code. It was really hard at first to figure out how to make it so that when the user guesses a color, odd/even, or a number
  it'll show up as correct or wrong. It was also really hard figuring out how to make it so that you lose or gain money if you win or lose in 
  the game. </p>
